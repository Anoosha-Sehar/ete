# Overview

ETE (Environment for Tree Exploration) is a toolkit that assists in
the automated manipulation, analysis and visualization of trees. It is
mainly written in Python, and includes many extra functionalities for
phylogenetic trees.

Its main features include:

- Read and write support for trees in Newick format
- Multiple functions for traversing, searching and manipulating tree topologies and node annotations
- Integration with NCBI Taxonomic database
- Integration with GTDB database
- Programmatic visualization framework
- Visualization of huge trees based on adaptive zooming
- Comparing trees
- Phylogenetic functions
  - orthology detection
  - phylogenetic distance?
- Command line tools
  - phylogenetic reconstruction protocols
  - tree comparison
  - tree diff

# Installation and documentation

The official website of ETE is http://etetoolkit.org. You can find
downloading instructions and further documentation there, or in the
next subsection specifically for ETE v4.

News and announcements are usually posted on twitter:

## Installation of ETE v4

To start
- Clone this repo to local computer with `git clone
  https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete.git` (or `git clone
  git@github.com:etetoolkit/ete.git` if you have the right
  permissions)
- Change to ete4 branch `git checkout ete4`
- Install dependecies
  - [Cython](https://cython.org/) (you can install it through
    [Conda](https://conda.io/) with `mamba install cython` or `conda
    install -c conda-forge cython`)
  - Additional dependencies: `flask flask-cors flask-httpauth
    flask-restful flask-compress numpy PyQt5` (you can
    install them with `pip install <list of dependencies>`)
- Build and install ete4 from repo's root directory: `pip install -e .`

(In Linux there may be some cases where the gcc library must be
installed, which can be done with `conda install -c conda-forge
gcc_linux-64`)

# Getting support

Rather than sending direct support-related emails to the developers,
it is better to keep the communication public.
